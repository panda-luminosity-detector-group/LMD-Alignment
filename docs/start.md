# TODO

We need scripts / jupyter notebooks to generate:

- [ ] ideal detector matrices from current geometry
- [ ] misalignment matrices (from some input parameters)
- [ ] scripts to do the actual alignment

# Docs

Document:

- [ ] how this software should be used (e.g. how to run the scripts, venv and all)
- [ ] what the other repo (Lumi Fit) is for and must do (here, we don't generate any data at all, only extract params and make alignment)
- [ ] how an alignment campaign is run (run LumiFit for data, then scripts here)
