# LMD-python-scripts

This is my collection of useful python scripts I wrote for the development of the LMD alignment. More info will come.

# Requirements

The requirements are generated with `pipreqs` (https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs):

```
pipreqs .
```

They can be installed with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
