# LMD-python-scripts

This is my collection of useful python scripts I wrote for the development of the LMD alignment. More info will come.

# Usage

The align scripts are in ´align´. They can be called with command line arguments in interactive fashion, or can be called object-oriented from the `simWrapper` python script.

# Requirements

These scripts work only with python3. The requirements can be installed with:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
